### Inspiration

**The Pragmatic Programmer**
The Pragmatic Programmer is a book I borrowed from a friend recently, the content of the book is nothing technical but full of thoughts from an experienced programmer. It makes realize how important it is to make DRY and maintainable code for the users and the team. Also, never stop learning as a programmer.

**A Web Accessibility Checklist**

An extremely comprehensive checklist for WCAG, it makes my life much easier to follow the web accessibility guideline for web development. This checklist is not only includes every rule you need to follow, also the guide to implement, which is simply awesome.

**Save the Air**
